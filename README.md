- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasterTK575, or just Tim.
- 👀 I recently became interested in programming, and have been learning on my own ever since.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python and Javascript as part of the CS50 course provided by Harvard.
- 💞️ Most of my current commits will be visible on me50/MasterTK575, as this is where we commit course work for CS50. Since this is private, I'm working on adding the repositories to my public profile.
- 📫 If there are any issues feel free to let me know, as I am still new to this.
- 📫 How to reach me: krambeck.t@gmail.com
